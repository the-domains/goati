Welcome to GOATI a funky little gift shop based in Milwaukee WI. 

Wifey, Mommy and Creator of Things!

I'm in love with art, whether it's drawing, painting, sewing, jewelry, woodworking or just doodles with my son. I constantly have new ideas! I tend to have a darker style even when I try not to but that's me. Everything I make is unique I spend time with each piece wether it's a purse or a necklace no one thing is ever quite the same, just like people all my pieces have personality or  a story sometimes even a song.

I like to say I'm a "Creator of Things" rather than an Artist only

because I do work with so many mediums and more importantly I have had no formal training. I am self taught in all my abilities and I am constantly learning new ways to recreate the ideas in my head.

This is where I make my jewelry.
