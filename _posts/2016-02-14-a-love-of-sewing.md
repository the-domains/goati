I grew up with the hum of my Grandmothers sewing machine it was only natural that I took up sewing. I remember falling asleep on the sewing table and sorting her needles and buttons. Once I cut the cord to her foot pedal putzing around with the scissors, I hope if that happens to me I would handle it as well as she did...I doubt it...

## And so I make a Tooth Fairy Pillow

My little guy will be losing his baby teeth soon I know it's not some super impressive thing but it's a new experience for me but the idea of teeth loosely under a pillow just weirds me out! What if the tooth fairy comes and doesn't find it...now I am digging through sheets, pillows and stuffed animals only to come up empty handed and finding it three days later being used as a cat toy....May be my imagination is a little too active.. So I figure I will make him a tooth pillow with a pocket. Not done yet but it's getting there..
