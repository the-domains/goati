I'm in love with art, whether it's drawing, painting, sewing, jewelry, woodworking or just doodles with my son! I constantly have new ideas! I tend to have a darker style even when I try not to but that's me.</p></article>

**Creating GoAti!**

GoAti: I chose the name GoAti because this whole endeavor is for my son and Goati is his nick-name.  
GoAti is a Gift shop because I love a variety of things when it comes to creating.  
I sew, draw, paint, build, bake etc... I like to say I'm a "Creator of Things" rather than an Artist only because I do work with so many mediums and more importantly I have had no formal training. I am self taught in all my abilities and I am constantly learning new ways to recreate the ideas in my head.  
I Started GoAti for a few reasons: I was running out of space to make things for my home and I want to do something that in the future will help my son, wether it is for college, a rainy day fund or travel the world experience. As a stay at home mom I do a lot with my son. He is my constant companion (a great one at that!) he is my inspiration and my second worst critic. I felt that I wanted to do something that would be a lasting gift, something we can build together and grow into something big that he could one day contribute to and benefit from. So that is how GoAti started.
